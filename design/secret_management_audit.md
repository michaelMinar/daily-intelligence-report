# Secret Management Plan – Audit & Recommendations

*Generated 2025‑06‑10*

## 1 · What Already Works Well

|   | Observation |
|---|-------------|
| ✅ **Clear goal‑setting** | Each phase states an outcome (“Enhanced env‑var validation working”, “.env support”), making PR reviews straightforward. |
| ✅ **Incremental roadmap** | Secret management is scoped to env‑vars first, deferring heavier Vault/keychain work to later iterations without blocking progress. |
| ✅ **Validation mindset** | The explicit `validate_config()` step and use of Pydantic models surface misconfigurations early, which is essential for CI reliability. |

## 2 · Potential Gaps & Risks

| ⚠️ Risk | Why it matters | Suggested guard‑rail |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Tight coupling of loader + models** | A “god file” in `config_loader.py` becomes brittle over time. | Keep the loader thin: define schemas in `models/config.py` and expose a `Settings.from_yaml()` factory so callers import the model, not the loader. |
| **Pydantic v1 vs v2 API drift** | v2 (mid‑2023) renamed `BaseSettings` to `BaseModel` and changed config style. | Decide on v1 or v2 now and pin the version in `pyproject.toml` to avoid silent CI breakage. |
| **No encryption‑at‑rest story** | `.env` files suffice locally but leave secrets in plain text on staging/prod runners. | Add a future step for SOPS‑encrypted files, AWS SM / Azure Key Vault, or GitHub OIDC → Vault. |
| **Test matrix not defined** | “Add integration tests” is broad; coverage may drift as config grows. | Spell out a matrix: with env, with `.env`, missing env, malformed env—use `pytest.mark.parametrize`. |
| **Linting / scan omissions** | Secrets can still slip into commits. | Add pre‑commit hooks: `detect‑secrets`, `yamllint`, `ruff`. Enforce them via CI. |

## 3 · Concrete Improvements to the Plan

1. **Adopt a typed settings class early**

   ```python
   # src/models/config.py
   from pydantic import BaseSettings, Field

   class LLMSettings(BaseSettings):
       provider: str
       api_key: str = Field(..., env="LLM_API_KEY")
       model: str = "gpt-4o-mini"

       class Config:
           env_file = ".env"
           case_sensitive = False
   ```

   _Benefits_: env expansion, validation, defaults, and `.env` support come “for free.” Your loader shrinks to ~20 lines.

2. **Define precedence ordering**

   ```
   # Highest ➜ lowest
   1. Explicit kwargs passed to Settings()
   2. OS environment variables
   3. .env file (if present)
   4. Defaults in the model
   ```

3. **Improve error UX**

   * Fail fast **and** show remediation tips  
   * Example: `Missing LLM_API_KEY. Set it via 'export LLM_API_KEY=<token>' or add it to .env`.

4. **CI secrets strategy**

   Add a dummy config‑load test so the GitHub Actions workflow fails if a required secret is absent:

   ```yaml
   env:
     LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
   ```

5. **Future‑proof for Vault/keychain**

   Sketch the resolver chain now (env → keychain → Vault) and implement a pluggable backend via a simple strategy pattern.

6. **Naming conventions**

   Use a consistent pattern like `DIR_LLM_API_KEY`, and document all keys in a `.env.example`.

7. **Return typed config**

   Have `validate_config()` return the validated `Settings` object so downstream services receive a strongly‑typed config rather than a raw dict.

## 4 · Suggested Deliverables to Add

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/configuration.md` | One‑page guide covering setup, precedence, adding new keys, and common errors. |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Hooks for `detect‑secrets`, `yamllint`, `ruff`, and `black`. |
| `tests/test_env_precedence.py` | Parametrized tests for the precedence rules. |
| `docs/adr/0002-secret-management.md` | Architectural Decision Record capturing the current approach and alternatives. |

---

## 5 · Bottom Line

Your phased plan is solid and keeps scope realistic for this branch. Tighten coupling boundaries, pin tool versions, and add explicit CI/lint hooks to guard against accidental secret exposure. Nail those pieces and the coding assistant should have a friction‑free path to merge.
