# Configuration System Implementation Plan

This document outlines how to implement and integrate the `config.yaml` configuration system into the Daily Intelligence Report project.

## Goals

- Decide on an implementation for secret management. This can be via keychain (on mac), env variables or something else. We should consider cross-platform support as we want to eventually run some CI integration tests on github workflows, which are built against linux
- Outline a design for the implementation below that an AI coding assistant can implement with code assist frameworks.
- Decide on what level of testing should be included as part of this commit/feature work.


### Best Practices

- Keep secrets out of `config.yaml` â€” use `${...}` and environment variables at minimum.
- Fail fast with informative errors if config is incomplete or invalid.
